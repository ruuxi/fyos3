# FYOS (FromYou OS)

This is a personal Ai desktop using webcontainers to work fully in the browser. This project is discontinued and is released for education purposes. 

It can create apps on demand, add Ai funtionality to apps (image/video/audio generation) and also output Ai generative content within the chat itself. It has a store for sharing to other users, and a chat feature to talk to your friends or the ai assitant. You can also modify the desktop itself instead of just creating apps. It's the user's personal environment to be shaped in any way they want.


Below is a readme generated by claude:

An AI-powered WebContainer workspace that enables users to chat with an intelligent agent capable of creating, managing, and running full-stack web applications directly in the browser.

## Overview

FYOS is a browser-based development environment where an AI agent can:
- Build and modify React applications in real-time
- Execute code and manage file systems using WebContainer
- Generate media (images, videos, music, 3D models) using AI
- Provide intelligent code editing with AST transformations
- Maintain conversation context across sessions

## Key Features

### AI Agent Capabilities
- **Multi-step reasoning** powered by Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **File system operations**: Read, write, find, and remove files
- **Code execution**: Run package manager commands and scripts
- **AST-based editing**: Precise code modifications without full rewrites
- **Project validation**: TypeScript type checking and linting

### Media Generation
- **Images**: Text-to-image and image editing (Google Nano Banana)
- **Videos**: Text/image-to-video generation
- **Music & Audio**: Song generation and sound effects (ElevenLabs)
- **3D Models**: Image-to-3D conversion

### Developer Experience
- **WebContainer integration**: Full Node.js environment in the browser
- **Terminal emulator**: Interactive terminal with xterm.js
- **Memory system**: Conversation context and session management
- **Dual personas**: Technical agent mode + friendly "Sim" persona

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15.5.2** with Turbopack
- **React 19.1.0**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library
- **Radix UI** primitives

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Convex** - Real-time database and backend
- **Clerk** - Authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Convex account
- Clerk account
- API keys for AI providers

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fyos.git
cd fyos
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required environment variables:
```env
# Convex
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# AI Provider Keys
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
FAL_KEY=
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=

# Optional: Base URL for deployments
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=
```

4. Set up Convex:
```bash
npx convex dev
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

### Creating Apps with the AI Agent

Simply chat with the agent to create applications:

```
"Create a todo app with a clean design"
"Build a drawing app with multiple colors"
"Make a music player that can play local files"
```

The agent will:
1. Scaffold the app structure
2. Apply thoughtful styling based on the app's purpose
3. Install necessary dependencies
4. Validate the code

### Generating Media

Request media generation directly:

```
"Generate a sunset image in watercolor style"
"Create a 10-second video from this image"
"Compose upbeat background music"
```

### Managing Sessions

The agent uses a memory system to maintain context:
- Sessions are automatically tracked
- Previous conversations are archived
- Use `memory_checkpoint` to start fresh on a new topic

## Development Scripts

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start dev server with Turbopack
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm start            # Start production server
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint

# WebContainer utilities
pnpm verify:webcontainer    # Verify WebContainer setup
pnpm migrate:webcontainer   # Migrate to templates
pnpm generate:snapshot      # Generate WebContainer snapshot
pnpm extract:lockfile       # Extract WebContainer lockfile
```

## Architecture

### Agent System
The AI agent operates through a tool-based architecture:
- **File operations**: CRUD operations on the virtual filesystem
- **Code editing**: AST-based transformations for precise modifications
- **Execution**: Package management and command execution
- **Validation**: TypeScript and ESLint integration
- **Memory**: Session-based context management

### WebContainer Integration
Applications run in isolated WebContainer instances:
- Full Node.js environment in the browser
- Real package installation via npm/pnpm
- Terminal access for debugging
- File system persistence

### Dual Persona System
- **Agent Mode**: Technical, detailed responses
- **Persona Mode**: Friendly "Sim" persona for user-facing messages
- Automatic translation between modes
