## Introduction

WebContainers run full Node.js toolchains directly in the browser, enabling zero-install, low-latency, secure, and scalable web-based development environments. They power interactive tutorials, playgrounds, and browser IDEs without relying on remote VMs.

**Key capabilities**

- Native Node.js runtime in-browser: run CLIs like Vite, Webpack, Next, etc. See the overview in the introduction guide. [Introduction](https://webcontainers.io/guides/introduction)
